I've been building software for over 15 years.
I've always wanted to write blog posts but had trouble getting started in long form writing.
GPT changed that and has made it a lot easier to get started.

As an engineer the goal really is to maximize output with reduced input.
Most of the content here is generative and optimized for prompt engineering.

Thanks for reading!
